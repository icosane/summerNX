English translation patch for Nintendo Switch homebrew port of `Amanatsu ~Perfect Edition~`
<br>It only works on **zxc944464161's PC port** which has the following title id: `0100CA584B72C000`

# Installation
1. Download `EN patch.7z` from Releases, unpack it
2. Copy folder `0100CA584B72C000` to `atmosphere/contents/`
3. Play game

There is a minor issue with the Settings background, due to layout differences between the EN PC version and the JP PC version (homebrew base).
